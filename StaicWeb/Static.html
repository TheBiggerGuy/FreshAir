  <h2><a name="wemakeradio">We Make Radio<a></h2>
  <p>
    Regardless of your expeirence, we'd love to help you present your own radio show. We can help you prepare and produce your show and make sure you show is exactly how you want it. If you're not sure what you'd like your show to be why not join one of our amazing HUB shows, where several people all contribute to the same show? This is a great way to practice your radio skills and work with other creative, enthusiastic radio folk. we are also well known for our socials, which allow everyone to get to know each other and make the station so famously fun and coherent.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a society, Freshair.org.uk is committed to giving as many opportunitiies to each member of the station as possible, whether this is through technical studio training, club DJ training, production workshops or our guest speakers who come from BBC Radio 1, Forth One and Capital FM and more. This commitment has led past freshair.org.uk members to enter employment with BBC TV, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 6Music, Galaxy, XFM and elsewhere. As an independant radio station, we have to raise all of our own funds; as a result, advertising and fundraising events are of key importance to the station. The events we put on vary from club nights to sell out gigs, from charity auctions to pub quizzes and even striping to our underwear and signing carols at Christmas in Princes Street - No, really! Our club nights, such as the famous 50s/60s night Twist & Shout, are enoumously popular and we are proud to showcase our strong line-up of DJs in the memership.
  </p>
  <p>
    We put on many gigs throughout the year and many artists come into our studios for sessions. Recently, we've put on Metronomy, Frightened Rabbit, Broken Records, Two Door Cinema Club and many, many more. We've also interviewed Tinie Tempah and Ewan McGregor live on air and had Chiddy Bang, Phil Jupitus, Wild Beasts and so many more live on air in our studio. And last year we put on the WORLD's FIRST bicycle-powered radio show live from Bristo Square. We're a massively dynamic station and there's a whole host of ways you can get involved.
